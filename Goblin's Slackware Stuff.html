<h1>Getting to know Slackware packaging tools</h1>


<p> There are two types of package tools; menu based tools and command line 
 based tools.
 There is actually only one menu based tool and that's "pkgtool" all the 
 rest are command line tools.</p>
 
 <p>
 You use pkgtool to get an overview of what's installed on your system. It 
 provides menu options to view installed packages, the content of 
 individual packages and you can also remove currently installed packages 
 by using the menus and you can install new ones. If you use pkgtool to 
 install packages, you can specify a directory containing one or more 
 packages and you will be asked a 'yes' or 'no' question about if you want 
 them installed.
 If you select to remove packages you will get a list of all currently 
 installed packages and you can then select one or more to remove.</p>
 <p>
 All of the above functions can also be accomplished by using the command 
 line tools. If, for example, you just need to install a single package, 
 it may seem a bit tedious to have to go through a lot of menus. That's 
 why we have the command line tools.
 Here's a description of each of them and how I mostly use them.</p>
 
 <h2>installpkg</h2>
 
 <div class="descr">Description:</div>
 <p>
 installpkg is used to install a prebuilt slackware package. Basically what 
 it does is to unzip and untar the package in the "/" (root) directory of 
 your filesystem, and subsequently it executes the script 
 "install/doinst.sh" from the package if it's included (try to unpack a 
 package from your slackware CD into a new directory and take a look at 
 it).i</p>

<p>
 How I use installpkg:
 <br><br>
 In almost all cases all I do is type a command like "installpkg 
 packagename.tgz" (or "installpkg packagename.tar.gz").
 In a few cases I may wish to review the content of a package before I install 
 it, so I issue a command like "installpkg -warn packagename.tgz &gt; 
 package.log". That gives me a file called package.log with information about 
 what files will be installed and where; and I can now judge if I wish to 
 install the package (if you omit the "&gt; package.log" part the report will be 
 dumped to your console).
 I rarely use the "-r" an "-m" options, they can be used to generate 
 and/or install a subdirectory as a package, but I prefer to use makepkg 
 for that.
 <br><br>
[Notes on Installing more than one package. Let's say you have the kde1 dir and you want to install everything,<br> you can cd into the kde1 dir and "installpkg *.tgz". Or you can "installpkg pack1.tgz pack2.tgz pack3.tgz"]</p>

 <h2>explodepkg</h2>
<div class="descr">Description:</div> 

 <p>
 explodepkg is used to extract a package into the current directory 
 without running the "install/doinst.sh" script from the package and 
 without updating the installed-packages database in "/var/adm/packages".
[note that /var/adm is a sym link to /var/log, so /var/log/packages is also correct]
 It's a useful tool if you are maintaining/updating a package (probably 
 one of your own) and want to change a few things.
 After using explodepkg and editing the package it is a simple matter to 
 run makepkg to recreate the package with the new and/or updated content.
 </p>
<p>
 How I use explodepkg:
 <br><br>
 There is only one way to use this tool; cd to an empty directory and type 
 "explodepkg packagename.tgz".

 </p><h2>removepkg</h2>
<div class="descr">Description:</div>
 
<p> 
 removepkg is used to remove a currently installed Slackware package. It 
 will look in "/var/adm/packages" for information about what files to 
 remove (the entry under /var/adm/packages was created when the package 
 was installed).</p>

<p>
 How I use removepkg:
 <br><br>
 Normally I just type<code>removepkg packagename</code>, but if I don't have the 
 original package on disk or CD-ROM or if I'm not completely sure if the 
 package is critical to normal systems operation I'll pass the "-preserve" 
 option to removepkg (as in "removepkg -preserve packagename") to keep the 
 entire tree of removed files under 
 "/tmp/preserved_packages/packagename"). This allows me to reinstall the 
 files if the system did indeed need them for something.
 Just as with installpkg you can pass the "-warn" option to get a dump of 
 the files that would be removed by the operation.
 Read the man page for a description of the "-keep" and "-copy" options if 
 you think you'll need them (I don't).</p>
 

 <h2>makepkg</h2>
 
<div class="descr">Description:</div>
 
 <p>
 This is the tool you'll use to create a proper Slackware package. What it 
 does is to tar and gzip the content of the current working directory and 
 it's subdirs while converting symlinks to script code on the fly (the 
 script code will be placed in a file called "doinst.sh" in a dir called 
 install) so as to be able to recreate links at package installation.
 </p>
<p>
 How I use makepkg:
 <br><br>
 Let me give you an example. Let's say we want to create a package called 
 "readme.tgz" that contains 3 files called "readme1", "readme2" and 
 "readme3".<br> When the package installs you want the files placed like this; 
 "/usr/readme1", "/usr/sbin/readme2" and "/home/readme3". To do that you 
 will need to create a new empty dir to create the package in, in this 
 example I'll assume you create a new dir called "/home/pkgmanager/readme" 
 and change to that directory ("cd /home/pkgmanager/readme").
 You can now start building your package. First we create the needed 
 directories, execute these commands:,<code>$ mkdir usr
$ mkdir usr/sbin
$ mkdir home</code>
 Then copy the files to their right locations, like this:<code>$ cp ~/readme1 usr
$ cp ~/readme2 usr/sbin
$ cp ~/readme3 home</code>
 
 Now we need to build the package itself, execute the command "makepkg 
 readme.tgz" to do just that.
 If there where any symlinks encountered (not in this example) you will 
 find that an "install" directory has been created with the "doinst.sh" 
 script to recreate them. This all goes into the package and if you feel 
 you have some extra commands that should be run from doinst.sh you can 
 explodepkg the package and add them to the script.
 You should now have a proper slackware package called "readme.tgz" that 
 will install properly with "installpkg readme.tgz". Try it out and see if 
 you can find the readme1, 2 and 3 files in their right locations.
 If you ever need to create a package of a program that you downloaded as 
 source (or binary) you will have to create the correct directory 
 structure for all the files in the package and follow the above procedure 
 (remember to compile the source first ;-). If the program uses 
 autoconf/automake, then life is a great deal simpler as you can usually 
 just pass the "--prefix=" parameter to the configure script to have "make 
 install" install it into some subdirectory of your choice. Then you can 
 run makepkg in that directory afterwards and that's it.
 Here is a generic example of creating a package from a source based on 
 autoconf/automake:<code>$ ./configure --prefix=/home/pkgmanager/builddir
$ make
$ make install
$ cd /home/pkgmanager/builddir
$ makepkg packagename.tgz</code></p>
 
 <h2>upgradepkg</h2>
 
 
<div class="descr">Description:</div>
 <p>
 This tool is used to upgrade an installed Slackware package with a new 
 version. All it does is to install the new package on top of the old one 
 and then remove all files from the old package that are not present in 
 the new one.
 <br><br>
 How I use upgradepkg:
 There are not that many ways to use it. Here's how it goes;
 If the old and new packages have the same name, the just type "upgradepkg 
 packagename.tgz", if the names are different, then use a command like 
 "upgradepkg oldpackage%newpackage.tgz".
[You can also upgrade multiple packages with upgradepkg by doing "upgradepkg *.tgz", as long as the packages you want to upgrade have the same name as the Slackware packs in the dir.]</p>
 
 <h2>Other notes:</h2>

 <p>
 Both installpkg, removepkg and upgradepkg support an env. variable called 
 "ROOT" that points to the root directory to use when installing or 
 removing packages. This is not something you'll generally use, but it can 
 be useful if you need to install packages to another harddrive/partition 
 or stuff like that.</p>

<p> There are two other types of scripts that you can place in a Slackware 
 package apart from "doinst.sh" (the configuration and only-once scripts) 
 but most people don't need to use them. Read the man page for makepkg if 
 you feel you need to know.<br>
 Remember to use ash script syntax in your package scripts if they are to 
 be used by anyone but yourself, as that's the shell that will be used if 
 the packages are installed from a Slackware rescue disk (and not all 
 people have bash installed ;-)
