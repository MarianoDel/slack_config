#### HACKS for xfce WM #####

Every application installs a .desktop file in /usr/share/applications that specifies application settings
(name, comment, exec command, icon, menu, etc). Edit the chromium desktop file located at
/usr/share/applications/chromium-browser.desktop and

change the Exec= line to read:
Exec=/usr/bin/chromium-browser --proxy-server=http://localhost:8008 %U


For the applications' shortcuts to be found, the .desktop files must be located in one of default directories,
 such as ~/.local/share/applications for current user or /usr/share/applications for all users.

Example setup
The following setup assumes that:

the shortcuts (.desktop files) have been created and include at least one category, which could be existent
(i.e. "System") or non-existent (i.e. "Custom", "Virtual");
the shortcuts have been moved to the shared or local directory i.e. ~/.local/share/applications;
the menu (.menu file) have been created such that the shortcuts from particular defined category is included (i.e. "Virtual");
the menu is placed somewhere appropriate i.e. ~/.config/menus directory
